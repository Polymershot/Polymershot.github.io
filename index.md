I am just an average stats student trying to learn and help others struggling like me!

I know the github page looks horrible but I am not trying to learn HTML!

It's time to start cooking in the lab...
What's on the list:
- Causal Inference
- Statistical Tests/Concepts
- ML methods
- Neural Network Concepts
- Data Wrangling/Cleaning
- SQL Concepts
- Regression
- (Insert any other buzzword!)
