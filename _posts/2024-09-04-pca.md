## Understanding PCA (The Big Picture & Proofs)

**Prerequisites**:
- Linear Algebra
- Calculus 3
- Up to Junior level Stat Courses (Probability/Stats Theory and Such)

This is mainly meant to strengthen the conceptial understanding of PCA (with some proofs that aren't too scary). Reading the two references alone should suffice for a much better understanding of PCA but for me, I had to put it all together in a different way. Hope this can help someone who always struggled with why the eigenvalues were sorted in descending order and what maximizing variance really means (Sorry if this is too much already!).
